Modern NICs implement various features in hardware, such as protocol offloading,
multicore supports, traffic control, and self virtualization. This approach
exposes several issues: protocol dependence, limited hardware resources, and
incomplete/buggy/non-compliant implementation. Even worse, the slow evolution of
hardware NICs due to increasingly overwhelming design complexity cannot keep up
in time with the new protocols and rapidly changing network architectures. We
introduce the SoftNIC architecture to fill the gap between hardware capabilities
and user demands. Our current SoftNIC prototype implements sophisticated NIC
features on a few dedicated processor cores, while assuming only streamlined
functionalities in hardware. The preliminary evaluation results show that most
NIC features can be implemented in software with minimum performance cost, while
the flexibility of software provides further potential benefits.
