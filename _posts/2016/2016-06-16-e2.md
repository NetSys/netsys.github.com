By moving network appliance functionality from proprietary hardware to software,
Network Function Virtualization promises to bring the advantages of cloud
computing to network packet processing. However, the evolution of cloud
computing (particularly for data analytics) has greatly benefited from
application-independent methods for scaling and placement that achieve high
efficiency while relieving programmers of these burdens. NFV has no such general
management solutions. To this end, we present E2 -- a scalable and
application-agnostic scheduling framework for packet processing.
