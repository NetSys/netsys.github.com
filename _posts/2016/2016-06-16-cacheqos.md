title: Providing Guaranteed Software Dataplane Performance
layout: default

---
Consolidated software dataplanes becoming increasingly commonplace. While
software dataplanes are well capable of high-performance packet processing in
isolation, their performance is adversely affected under co-execution. Due to
out-of-order execution and heavy use of pipelines in CPUs, there is no easy
approach to predict performance degradation without simplistic assumptions. In
this work, we are trying to understand if in-hardware QoS support for shared
resources is sufficient to guarantee steady performance in presence of all
possible competing processes. As a first step, we seek to find out to what
extent the (newly introduced) last-level cache QoS support in Intel Haswell Xeon
processors help us maximize the overall performance of co-running software
dataplanes while maintaining guaranteed performance for each of them
individually.
