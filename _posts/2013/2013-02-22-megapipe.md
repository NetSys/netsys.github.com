BSD Sockets has been a de facto standard API for network programming. 
While it provides a simple and portable way to perform network I/O, 
it shows suboptimal performance for "message-oriented" 
network workloads, where connections are short or messages are small.
This problem is exacerbated by its poor scalability on multi-core processors.
In this work, we explore the benefits of a clean-slate design of network APIs
aimed at achieving both high performance and ease of programming.
We present MegaPipe, a new API for efficient, scalable network I/O, and
evaluate its efficiency and effectiveness with a proof-of-concept implementation.
