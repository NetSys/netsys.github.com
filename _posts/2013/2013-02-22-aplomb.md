Middleboxes -- such as firewalls, proxies, and WAN optimizers -- have become almost ubiquitous in modern enterprises.
In a survey of 57 enterprise network administrators, we found that these devices, while popular, are costly, error prone, and hard to manage.
To ease these challenges, we developed APLOMB: a service for outsourcing middleboxes to the cloud entirely.
With APLOMB, enterprise clients tunnel all of their Internet traffic to and from a cloud provider; the traffic undergoes middlebox processing at the cloud before being forwarded out to the Internet at large.
Our implementation is built from open source components including <a href="http://www.vyatta.com">Vyatta</a> and <a href="http://www.openvpn.com">OpenVPN</a>; we hope to have a publicly-available service soon.
