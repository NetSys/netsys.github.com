title: Recursively Cautious Congestion Control
layout: default

---
Any congestion control mechanism has two primary goals - to fill the pipe and to do no harm to other flows in the network. These two goals conflict with each-other -- the former requires aggressiveness, whereas the latter requires caution. Traditional approaches use the same mechanism of sending rate to achieve these two conflicting goals. For example, TCP is deliberately cautious, avoiding overloads by starting with a small initial window and then iteratively ramping up, trying to fill the pipe.  As a result, it often takes flows several round-trip times to fully utilize the available bandwidth.  
RC3 decouples these two goals by sending additional packets from the flow using several layers of low priority service, therefore filling the pipe without doing any harm to the regular traffic. 
It can therefore, quickly take advantage of available capacity from the very first RTT to achieve near-optimal throughputs and smaller flow completion times while preserving TCP-friendliness  and fairness.
In common wide-area scenarios, RC3 results in a 40\% reduction in average flow completion times, with strongest improvements -- more than 70\% reduction in flow completion time -- seen in medium to large sized (100KB - 3MB) flows.
