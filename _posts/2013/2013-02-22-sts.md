Software bugs are inevitable in software-defined networking control software,
and troubleshooting
is a tedious, time-consuming task. In this paper we discuss how to improve
control software troubleshooting by presenting a technique
for automatically identifying
a minimal sequence of inputs responsible for triggering a given bug, without
making assumptions about the language or instrumentation of the software under
test. We apply our technique to five open source SDN control
platforms---Floodlight, NOX, POX, Pyretic, ONOS---and
illustrate how the minimal causal sequences our system found aided the
troubleshooting process.
