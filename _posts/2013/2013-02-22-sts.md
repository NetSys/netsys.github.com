Software bugs are inevitable in software-defined networking (SDN) control planes,
and troubleshooting
is a tedious, time-consuming task.
In this project we explore how one might improve SDN troubleshooting.
Our technique, retrospective causal inference,
automatically identifyies
a minimal sequence of inputs responsible for triggering a given bug in the
control software.
Retrospective causal inference works by
iteratively pruning inputs from the history of the execution, and
coping with divergent histories by reasoning about the functional equivalence
of events.
